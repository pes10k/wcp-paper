7. Diagrams of fast table lookups
1. Better understand secure OT example (why xors?)
- KDF function selection?


8. Note that there is lots more work in optimizing the cut-and-choose strategy
9. Explain how / that its possible to compose free XOR and GRR together
5. Summary of security section, discussing comparison to original Yao promises
6. Table explaining how free xor trick works



2. Further explan ways of constraining inputs from majority cut and choose
3. Explaining ways of ensuring P2 shares w/ P1
4. Better align garbling tables (just layout)
