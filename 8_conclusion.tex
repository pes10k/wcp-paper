\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper attempts to provide an overview of the field of \ac{SFE} using Yao's garble circuits protocol.  In addition to the techniques and approaches discussed in this paper, there is a great deal of related work in other fields that might be of interest for those interested in practical \ac{SFE}, such as zero-knowledge proof systems, performance optimizing \ac{OT} constructions, malleable claw-free collections, and verifiable secret sharing.
