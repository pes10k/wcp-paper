Secure function evaluation, or how two parties can jointly compute a function without any other party learning about any other party's inputs, has been an active field in cryptography. In 1986 Andrew Yao presented a solution to the problem called \emph{garbled circuits}, based on modeling the problem as a series of binary gates and encrypting the result tables. This approach was initial treated as theoretically interesting but too computationally expensive for practical use.  However, in the decades since Yao's solution was initially published, much work has gone into both optimizing the protocol for practical use, and further securing the protocol to make it useful in untrusted scenarios.

This paper provides a thorough explanation of both Yao's original protocol and its security characteristics.  The paper then details additions to the protocol to make it both practical for computation and secure against untrusted parties.  Implementations of Yao's protocol are also discussed, though the paper's emphasis is on the underlying enabling improvements to the protocol.
